/*
	- comments are marked like this '<<< comment >>>'

	some global comments:
	- I'm missing some structure/grouping in this file:
		- it is just a big soup of definitions
		- entrypoints seem to be at the end so you have to read backwards
		- the interface 'Extension' is on line 1384! (neither at the beginning, nor at the end)
	- it would be much easier to grasp the gist of the API if:
		- entrypoints would be at the beginning: start with namespaces and functions and 'Extension' because that is what devs are interested in.
		- then continue with the different extensible areas, workspace first, then editors, commands etc.
		- group the areas by some big separating comment that works like a section header with section overview.
		- in the section header explain the fundamental concepts of that section in a few sentences with forward links to the types and interfaces.
		- move auxiliary types/interfaces that are only used in the section towards the end of the section. So Range and Position would be at the end of the text section.
		- move fundamental (shared) types (e.g. CancellationToken etc.) to the end of the d.ts (but again group related items and use separator comments in between).
	- it would be helpful if the class or interface comment would explain how the class is used, i.e. how instances are created:
			the FileSystemWatcher is a good example:
				"To get an instance of a {{FileSystemWatcher}} use {{workspace.createFileSystemWatcher}}."
	- lots of class or method comments are still missing. If we cannot create all of them in time, we should focus on comments for non-obvious cases.
		I have added a "non-obvious" comment.

	- label, names, descriptions: would be great to indicate if they show up in the user interface and therefore must be human readable.
